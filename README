Port of Wave Robot Python Client to Ruby.
<http://code.google.com/p/wave-robot-python-client/>

Status:

* Not tested with any server.

* Unit tests pass.

* samples, robot.rb and __init__.rb not yet ported from Python to Ruby.

* APIs need a complete and thorough scrubbing.  In particular, they look like
    they were designed for Java, hastily ported to Python, and then even more
    hastily ported to Ruby; the last step done by someone who was clueless
    as to what was intended to be accomplished.
